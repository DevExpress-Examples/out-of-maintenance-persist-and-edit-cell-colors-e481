# Persist and edit cell colors


<p>The HtmlDataCellPrepared event is handled to provide individual cell background color, and attach a client-side function that provides cell selection. The JavaScript code uses the PerformCallback method to pass changed cell color to the server. The CustomCallback event is handled to persist changed cell colors.</p>
